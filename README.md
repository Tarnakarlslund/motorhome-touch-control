# motorhome-touch-control
A updated control for a old motorhome with Calira controls.
I have a old motorhome, a Fiat Dethleff A652 with Calira controls that i want to modernize.
I want to use a waveshare 7 inch touchdisplay, a raspberry pi 4, and a 8 channel relayboard.
I also want to control webcams mounted in all 4 corners of the caravan,
